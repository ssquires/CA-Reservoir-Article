            <p id="slide-1">In August 2014, people in the town of Montague near Shasta Mountain in California were limited to 5,000 gallons of water per home...</p>
            <p id="slide-2" style="display: none;">How early could we have known this would happen?</p>
            <p id="slide-3" style="display: none;">All over California - we have this water-level data, but can it be used to help us understand when and where we are most at risk of exhaustion?</p>
            <p id="slide-4" style="display: none;">It turns out - yes we can - but first we need to introduce a number called PDSI.</p>
            <p id="slide-5" style="display: none;">Reservoirs are not independent systems. They are interdependent and also depend on external factors such as PDSI. If we ignore external factors for now and just correlate the historical water levels of different reservoirs - this is what we get.</p>
            <p id="slide-6" style="display: none;">Once we include PDSI as a variable - it turns out a lot of the connections between reservoirs were just shared dependencies on PDSI. But this gives us another tool - for these reservoirs - we can now quantify their correlation/dependence on PDSI.</p>
            <p id="slide-7" style="display: none;">Wat</p>
            <p id="slide-8" style="display: none;">We can now revisit our view of California and instead of water-level, look at the risk that the water level will fall below a certain level!</p>
            <p id="slide-9" style="display: none;">Now we can look back at the case study and ask - how far in advance could we estimate the risk the water would have reached 10% capacity?</p>
            <p id="slide-10" style="display: none;">Discussion of how this could be used in policy - barriers etc.</p>
