            <p>&emsp;&emsp;In August 2014, the water level in Lake Shastina, Northern California, dropped critically low. People in the nearby town of Montague were limited to 5.000 gallons of water per home every month, facing fines for overuse.</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;The average household size in Montague in the 2010 census was 2.5.</p>
        </div>
        <p id="slide-1-2" style="display: none;">&emsp;&emsp;Showering for 10 minutes per day per person, the average household would use 2,800 gallons of water in a month.</p>
        <p id="slide-1-3" style="display: none;">&emsp;&emsp;With 5 minutes a day of running water per person, the average household would use another 1,400 gallons in a month.</p>
        <p id="slide-1-4" style="display: none;">&emsp;&emsp;Flushing the toilet twice per day per person would use 560 gallons.</p>
        <p id="slide-1-5" style="display: none;">&emsp;&emsp;Finally, one load of laundry and one load of dishes per week, per household, would use another 224 gallons.</p>
        <div id="slide-1-6" style="display: none;">
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;This example was for the "average" household size of 2.5 without a lawn or garden to water. A real family of three or above would almost surely have faced fines, which begs the question?</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;What can we do to predict critical situations like these?</p>
        </div>
        <p id="slide-2" style="display: none;">&emsp;&emsp;In order to properly manage water, particularly during drought conditions, reservoir managers need to be able to evaluate the risk, or probability, that any particular reservoir has of being exhausted.</p>
        <p id="slide-2-2" style="display: none;">&emsp;&emsp;Reservoirs are typically at their lowest in November before they recharge during the winter season. Here is a historical time series of three reservoirs in the California reservoir network from January 2003-November 2012. Can you predict whether any reservoir reaches below 10% capacity (a typical critical volume set out by water managers) from December 2012 - November 2016?</p>
        <p id="slide-2-3" style="display: none;">&emsp;&emsp;It is hard to guess what will happen based purely on historial water level data, especially for each individual reservoir.</p>
        <div id="slide-3" style="display: none;">
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;Presented here is a sample of major reservoirs in the four main hydrological zones of California. As time progresses and drought status fluctuates, we uncover the complexities that water managers have to deal with. How can they analyze this data to create best practices in water management? And can it be applied to understand exactly <strong>when</strong> and <strong>where</strong> we are most at risk of exhausting our resources?</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;Our data analysis tool must address the two challenges: <strong>reservoir interdependencies</strong> and <strong>impact of external factors</strong>.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="slide-4" style="display: none;">
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;Reservoirs are interdependent.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="slide-4-2" style="display: none;">
           <p>&emsp;&emsp;As an example, if the water manager of Folsom lake shuts off water release, that will impact reservoirs Don Pedro and Indian Valley that may now need to supply more water to account for Folsom. A natural approach to characterize these interdependencies is a graphical model where reservoirs are nodes and edges denote the strength of the dependencies.</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;Using data, we can learn the graph structure and precisely characterize how for example change of management of Folsom lake impacts the other reservoirs.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="slide-4-3" style="display: none;">
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;There are also external factors at play: reservoir behavior can be very strongly dependent to drought level (represented by Palmer Drought Severity Index), snowpack, and temperature as well as economic indicators such as the amount of agricultural output. We can add these factors into our graphical model as external variables.</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;Using data, we can answer the question: If the drought gets worse, what is the risk of reservoirs reaching critical capacities?</p>
        </div>
        <p id="slide-5" style="display: none;">&emsp;&emsp;We can now re-visit the example from earlier but looking at calculated risk.</p>
        <p id="slide-6" style="display: none;">&emsp;&emsp;</p>
        <p id="slide-7" style="display: none;">&emsp;&emsp;Wat</p>
        <p id="slide-8" style="display: none;">&emsp;&emsp;We can now revisit our view of California and instead of water-level, look at the risk that the water level will fall below a certain level!</p>
        <p id="slide-9" style="display: none;">&emsp;&emsp;Now we can look back at the case study and ask - how far in advance could we estimate the risk the water would have reached 10% capacity?</p>
        <p id="slide-10" style="display: none;">&emsp;&emsp;Discussion of how this could be used in policy - barriers etc.</p>
